## <a id = "cha"> </a> What is compressor-head-android?

*Compressor Head on Android* is an Android client that generates image URLs for the [Compressor Head](https://github.com/jboss-outreach/compressor-head) web application.
It takes various specifications of an image such as its **URL or source**, **width**, **height**, and **format** (PNG, JPEG or WEBP) as arguments to generate a usable image URL in accordance with the dimensions and format specified.

## <a id = "ch"> </a> What is Compressor Head?

Compressor Head is a fast web application based on [Python](https://www.python.org/) to resize images.
For a more detailed explanation, visit the [Compressor Head](https://github.com/jboss-outreach/compressor-head)
project. You can use this to compress images for websites which have a maximum capping for uploading an image or use it to scale up the images.

Create a new branch by:
```
git checkout -b YOUR_NEW_BRANCH_NAME
```
Then create/edit files as per your coding requirements. Ensure that your code is clean and efficient, and avoid redundancies. It is also advised to follow naming conventions as and where specified. Also make sure that your code is your own, and is not closed-source or stolen.

**Step 3: Commiting and pushing the changes:**

*Commit* the changes and *push* the commit to your forked repository on GitHub by:
```
# for including inidividual files
git add filename.extension
# for including all files at once
git add .
```
```
git commit -m"Your commit message here"
git push origin
```
If stuck at this point, refer [here](https://readwrite.com/2013/10/02/github-for-beginners-part-2/)

**Step 4: Sending a Pull Request (PR):**

Once you are done coding the changes, commit the files and create a [*PR*](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/). Click on "Compare across forks" when creating the PR, and select the master branch of this repo as the base. Set the head to your branch on your fork. Click on the button "Create Pull Request". Give your PR a meaningful title and a brief message explaining the purpose of your commits.

**Step 5: Ensuring code quality**

Once a PR has been created, check if it can be merged without any issues or conflicts. If there are any issues, repeat from **Step 2** and try to resolve them. Wait for a reviewer to cross check your changes, and then merge your changes.
